              "The flail mower mod. TRIFLEX is a machine with a wide cutting width of 420 or 500 cm. This model has an innovative double-jointed system, made of 3 independent flail decks, that allows mowing on any uneven ground without damaging the turf making it unique among the 3-unit horizontal cutting machines. The cutting height is adjusted, millimetrically, on each machine by the rear roller and on the side shredders by the front wheels Various models of knives are available depending on the intended use, such as Y knives for mulching on public parks, light delta knives for sports surfaces or heavy hammers for rough areas with pruning up to 3 cm in diameter and verticut knives for aerating turf. The gang flail mower mod. TRIFLEX performs mulching cut and uniform grass distribution on each pass. Some robust hydraulic cylinders lift mowing decks up to a total width of 225 cm for transport in complete safety. This machine is used by contractors for cutting large public or sports areas. Used by Airports, Golf Courses or large grass surfaces for fast maintenance where grass must be quickly absorbed from the ground. The flail mower mod. TRIFLEX has got a special PATENTED electro-hydraulic accessory that can be installed on request, used by public amenities personnel, which allows the lateral decks to be lifted and automatically blocking the flail shaft in 3 seconds so as to overcome any obstacles present during cutting in complete safety and fast way.",

              "The self-propelled remote-controlled flail mower Peruzzo mod. ROBOFOX ELECTRA, a top-notable novelty in the world of professional shredding, is equipped with FULL ELECTRIC propulsion, for both the advancement and for the drive of the cutting roller shaft. Equipped with 48 sturdy Y-knives or, optionally, 24 forged hammers, it is the ideal machine to cut grass and shrubs up to 2/3cm in diameter and brush on steep slopes: all in full respect of the surrounding environment. The powerful batteries supplied with the ROBOFOX ELECTRA, guarantee a range of about 2/3 hours (in relation to working conditions), without any emission of fumes in the atmosphere, nor of noise pollution, in absolute silence at all stages of work. An additional battery pack is easily replaceable, allowing the machine's working range to double. These prerogatives allow a widespread use in urban areas, where there is an increasing demand for a low sound impact and a precise compliance with anti-pollution regulations, which are now more stringent than ever before. The self-propelled remote-controlled flail mower Peruzzo mod. ROBOFOX ELECTRA is operated through an easy-to-use multifunction radio control, with a range of up to 300 meters and adjusted according to the CE safety frequencies. This allows the operator to always work in maximum safety.In optimal ground conditions, the work inclination achievable by the machine during the work phases is 55°. For every extreme need, a sophisticated electronic slope tilt sensor is available on demand that manages the limit tilt level, preventing the machine from tipping over. This machine comes with a standard safety rollbar added in order to preserve the most delicate components in the event of a rollover. La ROBOFOX ELECTRA is equipped with a drift control system, always managed comfortably by the remote control, which ensures its linear progress in the phases of work, even in the presence of slippery slopes. The compact dimensions of the ROBOFOX ELECTRA lead it to be the perfect solution in the phases of work in small spaces, such as for mowing the grass under solar panels, in the presence of narrow access, in particularly inclined areas or of poor access. The volumes and size of the flail mower allow a smooth loading-discharge on vans and pick-ups of different types. If you have any doubts and/or clarification regarding the ROBOFOX ELECTRA, don't hesitate to contact us directly.",
